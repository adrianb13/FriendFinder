# FriendFinder

This app uses node.js, express.js, and jQuery to bring you an app to a website that allows you to find you new Best Friend! :)

The home route takes you to the front page where you are given and intro and able to click a link to the survey screen to find you new best friend.

Once you click the link, the survey comes up where you are asked to enter your name, a link to you photo, and 10 questions where you select a 1-5 option. 

Based on your results, you will be matched up with an existing client and shown their name and picture.
